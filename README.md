This is an upload of my signed LMS project with the Books.java class, Library Courses class and a Main that is controlling all of the methods declared in these classes, prompting users to enter information based on the services they have decided to get at the library. As we progress in the course, I will be revieing and updating the code as well as my original design included some additional classes such as the LibraryUsers class and LibraryEvents class.
